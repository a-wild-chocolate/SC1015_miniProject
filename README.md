## About:

Contained within are the source codes for our SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial intelligence) Mini-Project.
Our mini-project utilizes the mushroom classification dataset corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms drawn from “The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981)” and 400 images of random mushrooms with classification from Wiki and MushroomWorld.  
## Files Included:  


## Problem Definition:  **"Is this mushroom edible or poisonous?"**  
The objective of this project is to develop machine learning algorithms and AI models to investigate the identifiable characteristics of a poisonous mushroom and use ML models to predict whether they are edible.

## Models Used:  
1)	Decision Tree Model
2)	Random Forest Classification
3)	Convolution Neural Network (CNN) 

## Conclusion:

There are many characteristics which when analysed shows that they are unique to poisonous mushrooms.  

Both the machine learning algorithms which used the Kaggle dataset were similar in their accuracy rate, 99 and 100% respectively while the CNN which uses images of random mushrooms only returned an accuracy rate of 80%. However, CNN is a lot easier to use in application as users can simply take a picture of any mushroom while the machine learning algorithms would require users to analyse and input 22 characteristics.   

The **Kmode algorithm and proportion method** used to analyse the data also returned relatively accurate key characteristics of poisonous mushrooms.  

The dataset from Kaggle is based a hypothetical data set from only 2 families of mushrooms which may have made the machine learning models overfitting.  

While the high demand of running CNN on home computers limited the number of epochs we were able to run which may have reduced the accuracy rate.  

## What did we learn from this project?  
As our dataset happened to be **entire categorical** while most of what we learnt in class was for numerical datasets, we learnt many methods to process and evaluate categorical data. Of which methods include:  
1)	One-Hot Encoder  
2)	KMode  
3)	Fit-Transform  
4)	LabelEncoder  
5)	PCA  
6)	Keras Image Augmentation API  
New Models learnt include:  
1)	Random Forest Classification  
2)	Convolution Neural Network (CNN)
